# Quick Start Ruby & Rails

This tutorial is an introduction to Ruby and Rails (Rails is a web framework for the Ruby programming language).

The tutorial requires only a basic knowledge about the web, how it works and a bit of familiarity with tools like a text editor and the terminal/shell. If you are completely unfamiliar with the terminal, we wrote a short introduction to [get you started](https://github.com/vienna-rb/Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby/wiki/Introduction-to-the-terminal).

You can find a few pointers where to start, what is recommended to use and tips in the [Wiki](https://github.com/vienna-rb/Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby/wiki).

To start, clone this "repository" with Git. Git helps you keep track of changes you make to your project/code; if you are not familiar with Git yet, [this codeschool tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) is a great resource. Got Git up and running? Go forth and run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/vienna-rb/Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby.git
```

Or [Download it as a Zip-file](https://github.com/vienna-rb/Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby/archive/master.zip)

Open the folder in your terminal:

```
cd Quick-Start-Rails-and-Ruby
```

Also open the folder in your preferred text editor (we recommend [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

Go to [doc/index.md](doc/index.md) and start.
