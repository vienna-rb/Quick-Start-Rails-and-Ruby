# Create the application

In your terminal type the following (<span style="display:inline-block;float:right;margin-top:-3.5em;margin-right:.5em;position:relative;">:whale:</span>):

```shell
rails new todo-application
```

You'll see a number of things happening. All of it is creating the basic structure of the application in a new folder named `todo-application`. The `cd todo-application` command will bring you into that folder. Open the folder in your editor and take a look at what is in there. The part you will mostly work in is `app`.

Run bundle install in your application directory:

```shell
bundle install
```
